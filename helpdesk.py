"""Help or Requests: staff ask for help or make a request, and admins answer them on the FAQs page.

Teachers send a message from the Help or Requests button at the bottom of their dashboard. It lands on the admins'
FAQs page (/admin/faqs), where an admin types a reply and sends it in the app, or in the app and by email. The
teacher sees the reply in the same pop-up, with a dot on the button until they open it.

Every Sunday at 12:00 London time the weekly summary goes to HELP_SUMMARY_TO (mysafaradmin@gmail.com unless set):
everything sent since the Sunday before, or a line saying nothing was. A thread in the web process checks once a
minute; help_summaries records each week's email, so it goes once even with a restart or a second process, and a
summary missed while the site was down goes out when it comes back, if that is still the same Sunday or Monday.
