"""Sends the dashboard's emails through Resend's HTTPS API.

Railway blocks outbound SMTP on the Hobby plan, so mail goes over HTTPS.
Without RESEND_API_KEY and MAIL_FROM nothing is sent, and admins copy the link
from the Manage users page instead. What each email says is in emails.py and
templates/email/.

Every email has an HTML part and a plain-text part. A failed send is retried
once when Resend is busy or briefly unavailable; the Idempotency-Key header
makes sure a retry can't deliver the same email twice.

MAIL_REDIRECT_TO, when set, sends every email to that one address instead of
the real recipient. Use it while testing so that no staff member is emailed.
MAIL_REPLY_TO (or SUPPORT_EMAIL) is where replies go, since the sending
address doesn't receive mail.
