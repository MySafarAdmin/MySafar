"""Safar dashboard server: staff sign-in and shared class records.

Records are kept in PostgreSQL when DATABASE_URL is set (on Railway, a reference
to the PostgreSQL service's DATABASE_URL). Without it they are kept in a SQLite
file in DATA_DIR, which is meant for running locally. See db.py.

Each classroom is one row of the `classrooms` table. Classrooms are created from
the dashboard (CSV upload) by an admin. Teachers see and edit only the
classrooms an admin has assigned to them. Every save and delete is recorded in
`classroom_history` and `audit_log`, which are kept for RETENTION_DAYS.
